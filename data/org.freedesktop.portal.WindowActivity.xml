          The "FocusedWindowChanged" signal will need modifications.

    org.freedesktop.portal.Settings:
    @short_description: Settings interface

    This interface provides access to the current state or changes of the
    shells open windows. For example, allows an application to be informed
    about the name of all windows, which window is currently focused and which
    windows are currently mimimized.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.WindowActivity">

    <!--
      GetWindows:
      @windows: array of open windows.

      A window has the following properties:
      - 0: title
      - 1: appid
      - 2: visible (false means hidden/minimized)
      - 3: has focus (multiple windows can have focus if there are multiple
           seats)

      TODO: Is an tuple like this OK, or should we use a dict with property
            names in the message? Each have their own pros and cons
            - having tuple: Small payloads.
                            Forward compatibility if we want more properties is
                            possible by adding more items to the end of the
                            tuple.
                            Quite hard to understand which each field means,
                            unless you read the documentation.
            - having dict:  Large payloads
                            Forward compatiblity possible by just adding new
                            keys with new names.
                            Easy to understand which each field means.
